# Broomn's Blog

Chronicles from Broomn, the druid storyteller. A place for stories worth sharing around the fire.

Built from scratch with Node.js, deployed on AWS serverless infrastructure.

## What is this?

A full-stack blog application with:
- Public blog with posts, tags, and newsletter subscription
- User registration via Google OAuth (through AWS Cognito)
- Authenticated users can comment on posts
- Admin panel to manage posts, moderate comments, and send newsletters
- Scheduled post publishing (set a future date, post goes live automatically)

## Current Status

**Phase: Local Development Complete**

The API and frontend are fully implemented and working locally. Infrastructure (AWS deployment) has not been started yet.

### What's working

- ✅ REST API with all CRUD endpoints (posts, comments, newsletter, auth)
- ✅ 49 passing tests covering all API modules
- ✅ Role-based access control (public, authenticated user, admin)
- ✅ JWT authentication with access/refresh token flow
- ✅ Cognito integration (ready — needs AWS infrastructure)
- ✅ Newsletter with HMAC-based email confirmation/unsubscribe tokens
- ✅ Frontend with all pages (public blog, admin panel, auth flow)
- ✅ Auth context with token management and auto-refresh
- ✅ Protected admin routes (redirects to login if unauthenticated)
- ✅ Rich text editor (Tiptap) for creating/editing posts
- ✅ Dark mode with toggle (persists preference)
- ✅ Comment section on post detail page with moderation
- ✅ SEO metadata (dynamic og:title, description, og:image per post)
- ✅ Mulgore-inspired visual identity (landscape hero, druidic emblem, vine dividers)
- ✅ Custom typography (Cinzel headings, Lora body — manuscript/scroll feel)
- ✅ i18n: Portuguese (default) + English with language switcher
- ✅ On-the-fly post translation via MyMemory API (preserves HTML structure)
- ✅ TypeScript compiles clean across both projects

### Known Issues

- **Next.js 15.3.9 build warning**: The build emits a non-fatal warning about `/404` page prerendering (`<Html> should not be imported outside of pages/_document`). This is a confirmed framework bug where Next.js internally generates a legacy pages-router `/404` page even in app-router-only projects. The validation check fires against the framework's own internal rendering. We added `src/pages/_document.tsx` and `src/pages/_error.tsx` to make the error non-fatal (build exits 0), but the warning message persists. **The app runs perfectly fine** — the app router's `not-found.tsx` handles 404s correctly for users.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Version |
|---|---|---|
| **API** | Node.js + Fastify | 5.10 |
| **Language** | TypeScript | 5.8 |
| **ORM** | Prisma | 6.10 |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL (Docker locally, Aurora Serverless v2 on AWS) | 16 |
| **Frontend** | Next.js (App Router) | 15.3.9 |
| **UI** | React | 19 |
| **CSS** | Tailwind CSS | 4 |
| **Auth** | Amazon Cognito (Google OAuth) | — |
| **Testing** | Vitest | 3.2 |
| **Package Manager** | npm | — |

### Why these choices?

- **Fastify over Express**: Faster, better TypeScript support, built-in validation, cleaner plugin system. No reason to start a new project with Express in 2026.
- **Prisma**: Schema-first ORM with auto-generated types, readable migrations, excellent DX with PostgreSQL.
- **Next.js 15 + React 19**: Latest stable versions. App Router is the modern Next.js pattern (server components, layouts, streaming).
- **Tailwind v4**: Ships with Next.js 15's scaffolding. Uses `@import "tailwindcss"` syntax instead of v3's directives.
- **Vitest over Jest**: Native ESM support, faster, compatible with the same APIs.
- **Separate projects (not npm workspace for frontend)**: Next.js has dependency resolution issues when hoisted in a workspace with other packages (React version conflicts). The API remains in an npm workspace; the frontend manages its own `node_modules`.

## Data Model

- **User**: email, name, avatar, role (ADMIN/USER), Google/Cognito IDs
- **Post**: title, slug (auto-generated), excerpt, content (HTML), cover image, status (DRAFT/PUBLISHED), publishedAt (enables scheduling)
- **Tag**: name, slug — many-to-many with posts
- **Comment**: content, approved flag, belongs to user and post
- **Newsletter**: email, status (PENDING/CONFIRMED/UNSUBSCRIBED), optional user link

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20 (tested on Node 25 — see note below)
- Docker (for PostgreSQL)
- npm

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Start the database
docker compose up -d

# 2. Set up the API
cd api
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run db:migrate    # Type "init" when prompted for migration name
npm run db:seed       # Creates admin user, test user, and a sample post
npm run dev           # Starts on http://localhost:3001

# 3. Set up the frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev           # Starts on http://localhost:3000
```

Open http://localhost:3000 — you should see the "Hello World" sample post.

### Dev authentication

Since Google OAuth (Cognito) requires AWS infrastructure, we provide a **dev-only login endpoint** for local development:

```bash
# Get an admin JWT token
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/auth/dev-login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@broomns-blog.local"}'

# Get a regular user token
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/auth/dev-login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@broomns-blog.local"}'
```

Use the returned `accessToken` in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to access admin endpoints.

**This endpoint only exists when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.** It will never be available in production.

### Seeded users

| Email | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `admin@broomns-blog.local` | ADMIN | Create/edit posts, moderate comments, send newsletters |
| `user@broomns-blog.local` | USER | Test commenting as a regular user |

### Node.js 25 note

Node.js 25 introduced a built-in `localStorage` global that requires `--localstorage-file` to function. Next.js's dev overlay uses `localStorage` internally, which crashes on Node 25 without this flag. The frontend's `dev` script includes `NODE_OPTIONS='--localstorage-file=.next/.localStorage'` to handle this. If you're on Node 20–22, this is harmless.

### Running tests

```bash
cd api
npm test              # Runs all 49 tests
```

## Authentication Flow

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" → redirected to Cognito Hosted UI
2. Cognito handles Google OAuth → redirects back with authorization code
3. Frontend exchanges code for tokens via Cognito's token endpoint
4. Frontend sends the Cognito ID token to `POST /auth/google`
5. API verifies the ID token using Cognito's JWKS public keys
6. API upserts the user in the database and issues its own JWT pair:
   - **Access token** (15 min) — sent on every request
   - **Refresh token** (7 days) — used to get new access tokens

## Architecture Decisions

### Post scheduling via publishedAt

Rather than a simple boolean "published" flag, we use a `publishedAt` datetime combined with a `status` enum. A post is visible when `status = PUBLISHED AND publishedAt <= now()`. This means:
- Set publishedAt to now → immediately visible
- Set publishedAt to a future date → scheduled, becomes visible automatically at that time
- No cron jobs needed — the query handles it

### HMAC tokens for newsletter

Instead of storing confirmation tokens in the database, we generate HMAC tokens: `base64url(subscriberId + ":" + hmac(subscriberId, secret))`. The token can be verified without a database lookup, and there's nothing to expire or clean up.

### Comment moderation

Comments are created with `approved = false` by default. They only appear publicly after an admin approves them. Comment owners can delete their own comments; admins can delete any comment.

### Frontend outside npm workspace

Next.js has known issues with React version resolution when placed in an npm workspace alongside other packages. The frontend manages its own `node_modules` independently to avoid duplicate React instances causing `useContext` errors during build.

## What's Next (Planned)

These are the remaining pieces to complete the project, roughly in priority order:

### Infrastructure (AWS CDK)
- [ ] Aurora Serverless v2 (PostgreSQL) cluster
- [ ] Cognito User Pool with Google Identity Provider
- [ ] Lambda functions for the API (behind API Gateway)
- [ ] S3 bucket for media uploads
- [ ] CloudFront distribution for the frontend
- [ ] SES configuration for newsletter emails
- [ ] Secrets Manager for environment variables

### API enhancements
- [ ] SES integration for newsletter sending (currently stubbed)
- [ ] SES integration for confirmation emails
- [ ] S3 presigned URL endpoint for image uploads
- [ ] Pagination cursors for better performance at scale
- [ ] Request rate limiting per user (not just per IP)

### Frontend enhancements
- [ ] Complete the OAuth callback (Cognito token exchange)
- [ ] Image upload in post editor

### DevOps
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI pipeline (lint, test, build)
- [ ] Deployment pipeline (CDK deploy on merge to master)
- [ ] Environment separation (dev/staging/prod)

## Contributing

This is a personal project. If you're reading this as a collaborator or future-me, the key things to know:

1. **API pattern**: routes → controllers → services → repositories. Add new features by following the existing post/comment/newsletter pattern.
2. **Tests**: Run `npm test` in `api/` before committing. Add tests for new endpoints.
3. **Frontend**: Run `npm run dev` in `frontend/`. TypeScript errors caught by `npx tsc --noEmit`.
4. **No commits to master without tests passing.**
5. **Always update this README** when adding features or changing architecture before raising a PR.
